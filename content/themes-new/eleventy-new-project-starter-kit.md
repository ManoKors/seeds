  This starter kit consists of an Express REST API with CRUD capabilities,
  powered by a Node server, connected to a MongoDB database with Mongoose, and
  configured for Heroku deployment. This powers a client-side JAMstack static
  website built with Eleventy, Gulp, PostCSS, and Webpack, and configured for
  deployment to a CDN via Netlify. The full stack has CI/CD setup - deploy both
  server and client by merging a pull request into the master branch on GitHub.
  Sass is linted, transpiled into CSS, post-processed with PostCSS, beautified
  in development, and minified in production, with source maps. JavaScript is
  linted, transpiled with Babel, bundled with Webpack, concatenated, and
  minified in production, with source maps.
